# UI Portfolio - README

## Overview
This is a responsive UI Portfolio website built with HTML and CSS, showcasing a clean, modern design for a web developer/designer. The portfolio features multiple sections including a hero banner, about section, services, skills, portfolio gallery, and contact information.

## Solution Approach

### HTML Structure
1. **Semantic HTML5**: Used semantic elements (`header`, `section`, `footer`) for better accessibility and SEO
2. **Modular Components**: Organized content into logical sections (Home, About, Services, Skills, Portfolio, Contact)
3. **Responsive Navigation**: Implemented a responsive navbar with toggle functionality for mobile
4. **Grid & Flex Layouts**: Combined grid and flexbox for complex responsive layouts
5. **Accessibility**: Included proper alt text for images and ARIA attributes where needed

### CSS Architecture
1. **Mobile-First Approach**: Designed for mobile devices first, then enhanced for larger screens
2. **CSS Variables**: Used consistent color variables for easy theming
3. **BEM Methodology**: Applied Block-Element-Modifier naming convention for maintainable CSS
4. **Responsive Design**: Implemented fluid layouts with media queries at key breakpoints
5. **Performance Optimizations**: Minimized render-blocking CSS and optimized animations

### Key Features
- **Responsive Hero Section**: Full-screen banner with layered background effect
- **Skills Visualization**: Animated progress bars for skill proficiency
- **Portfolio Gallery**: Responsive grid of project thumbnails
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle button for theme switching (JavaScript needed for full functionality)
